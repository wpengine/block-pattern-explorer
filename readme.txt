An experimental plugin to preview and insert block patterns in the Block Editor.

== Description ==

An experimental plugin to preview and insert block patterns in the Block Editor (Gutenberg).

Please note that no block patterns are included with this plugin. Patterns must be provided by your theme or another plugin. You can also use the patterns provided by WordPress if enabled by your theme.

Furthermore, this plugin should be used in conjunction with the [Gutenberg plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/) until WordPress 5.9 is officially released on January 25, 2022.

=== Mission ===

The Block Pattern Explorer is heavily influenced by the work currently being done in the Gutenberg [GitHub repository](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg) on pattern previews.

The purpose of this project is to isolate the pattern explorer into a standalone plugin that WordPress users/developers can interact with immediately, provide feedback on, and begin implementing into their own websites. Ideally, this initiative will also help inform the direction of core development.

Once the pattern explorer is fully integrated into WordPress proper, this project will be sunsetted in favor of the core offering.
