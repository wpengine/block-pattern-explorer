The Block Pattern Explorer is an experimental WordPress plugin based **heavily** on the work currently being done in [Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg).

The purpose of this project is to isolate the pattern explorer into a standalone plugin that WordPress users/developers can interact with immediately, provide feedback on, and begin implementing into their own websites. Ideally, this initiative will also help inform the direction of core development.

Once the pattern explorer is integrated into WordPress proper, this project will be sunsetted in favor of the core offering.

### Requirements

- For best results, it's recommended that you use the Block Pattern Explorer is conjunction with Gutenberg, at least until WordPress 5.9 is released.
- You need to have the Block Editor enabled on your WordPress site.

### Follow Core Development
